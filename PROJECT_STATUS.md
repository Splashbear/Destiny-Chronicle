# Project Status Report

## Iteration: Account Stats Calculation and Summary UI (May 2025)

### Overview
This iteration introduces a new feature to calculate and display total account statistics for Destiny players, including total time played, total activity time, total activity count, and per-type activity breakdown (Raid, Dungeon, Strike, PvP, Gambit, Other). It also adds a visual loading indicator for the stats calculation process.

### Steps Implemented
1. **Data Aggregation**
   - For each selected player and their characters, fetch:
     - Total time played (from character profile)
     - Total activity count (from Bungie API per character)
     - All activities for each character (from local DB)
   - Sum totals across all characters for the account.
   - Group and sum activities by type (Raid, Dungeon, Strike, PvP, Gambit, Other).
2. **UI Integration**
   - Added a loading indicator (spinner) while stats are being calculated.
   - Displayed a summary section with:
     - Total time in Destiny (all characters)
     - Total time in activities (sum of durations)
     - Total activity count
     - Per-type activity counts and times
3. **Performance**
   - Stats calculation is triggered after all activities are loaded.
   - Uses async/await to avoid UI blocking.

### Benefits
- **User Experience:** Users see a clear, concise summary of their Destiny account activity.
- **Performance:** Efficient aggregation and display of stats after data is loaded.
- **Clarity:** Visual feedback during loading, and organized stats by type.

### Integration Points
- Stats calculation is triggered after all activities are loaded for selected players.
- The summary UI is displayed above the activity history section.
- The loading indicator is shown while stats are being calculated.

### Next Steps
- Optionally, add streak calculations and display.
- Allow filtering or drill-down by activity type.
- Add error handling for API failures during stats calculation.

### Recent Major Changes
- **Date Filtering and Timezone Handling:** Improved the date filtering logic to ensure activities are displayed correctly based on the user's local timezone. This ensures that activities are accurately grouped by date, regardless of the user's location.
- **Guardian Firsts Feature:** Implemented a new feature to track and display the first completion of each unique raid or dungeon. This feature now correctly identifies the true first completion, regardless of difficulty, and filters out any duplicate entries.
- **UI Enhancements:** Moved the Guardian Firsts section to a right-side column, making the daily activities cards the main focus in the center. This layout change improves the overall user experience by providing a clearer view of daily activities.
